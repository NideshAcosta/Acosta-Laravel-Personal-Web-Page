        &emsp;&emsp;Hoping for the future and planning goals can be pretty ambitious for us, humans, who don't know the end of us. But on the other side, it can help us to be motivated on 'today'. <br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;Six years from now, and by the grace of God, I'm still a web developer with a healthy work environment and an above-average salary. Our family would own a blessed business. Hopefully, we can also have a car, and the finishing of our house will be made possible. I'm still serving the Lord with my family, keeping a healthy and intimate relationship with Him. And I'll be a better version of what I am today.<br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;Every time I am asked what I can picture out yrs from today, I feel kinda pressured to do better on 'right now' since I know that every step I take and every decision I make will impact my tomorrow. To be honest, it's scary to walk into a path full of uncertainties, but I'm so blessed to be held by the all-knowing God. I can dream big because I know how powerful my God is, and I can sleep soundly despite the ups and downs, knowing that God is in control and He only wants the best for me.<br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;I encourage you to step out, allow yourself to be held by God, and dream about the future! Just don't forget to enjoy the current moment since you once dream about it in the past.
