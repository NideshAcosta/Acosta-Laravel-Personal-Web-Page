        &emsp;&emsp;Hi! I'm Nidesh Acosta, a 3rd year student taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I like solving problems and challenging myself to think of multiple ways on how to get through every problems. My passion for designing and keeping keen eye for details helps me in producing better quality results. But along with all of these, I highly believe that everything I have, and will continue to posses, is all by the grace of God.  I consider myself weak without God, and strong with Him. <br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;I'd be happy to connect with you and talk about anything under the sun. You can connect with me <a class="link" href="/contact">here!</a> Hope you have a nice day, ahead!
