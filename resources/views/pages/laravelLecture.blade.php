        &emsp;&emsp;Laravel Breeze is a lightweight, straightforward implementation of all of Laravel's authentication functionality, including as login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. The default view layer of Laravel Breeze is built up of basic Blade templates decorated using Tailwind CSS.<br> 
        &emsp;&emsp;Breeze is an excellent starting point for a new Laravel application and is also an excellent solution for projects who want to take their Blade templates to the next level using Laravel Livewire.<br>
