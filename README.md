Hi! This is my Personal Laravel Web Page.

After cloning this repo, kindly copy the following from your previous laravel project:
- node_modules folder
- vendor folder
- .editorconfig
- .env
- .env.example
- .gitattributes
- .gitignore
- .styleci.yml

Then paste it to the cloned version of this repository in your local machine.

After opening the folder in VS Code, type in the terminal "php artisan serve". Then open the browser and paste the link given by the VS Code (usually it's http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

Hopefully, after all of these steps, you can now view my Personal Laravel Web Page. Thanks for being patient with the procedure! Have a nice day.ðŸ˜€
